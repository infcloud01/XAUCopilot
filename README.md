## 🚀 Overview

**XAUCopilot** is an autonomous multi-agent AI system designed to simulate a professional trading desk. Unlike simple trading bots that rely on a single script, XAUCopilot utilizes **CrewAI** to orchestrate two distinct personalities that debate and collaborate to generate high-probability trade signals for Gold (XAU/USD).

*   **Agent 1: The Research Manager** (Fundamental Analysis) - Scours the web for the latest Fed news, inflation data, and geopolitical events to determine the macro sentiment.
*   **Agent 2: The Technical Analyst** (Quant/Technical Analysis) - Reads price data, calculates indicators (RSI, EMA), and combines the Manager's sentiment with chart logic to execute trades.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **100% Free Data Tools:** Uses `ddgs` (DuckDuckGo) for news and `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance) for price data. No expensive API subscriptions required.
*   **Custom Math Engine:** Includes a custom Python Tool that calculates **RSI (14)** and **50 EMA** locally, preventing "LLM Math Hallucinations."
*   **Smart Timeframes:** Automatically downloads 1-Hour data and resamples it into **4-Hour Candles** for Swing Trading analysis using Pandas.
*   **Recency Filters:** Enforces strict time limits (`timelimit='d'`) on search results to ensure the AI reacts to *today's* news, not last year's.
*   **Date Awareness:** The system injects the current date into the Agent's context, allowing it to function correctly in any timeframe.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a sequential process:

1.  **Manager** searches DuckDuckGo for keywords like "Fed Outlook" and "Gold Price News."
2.  **Manager** verifies the dates of the articles and outputs a Sentiment Report (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral).
3.  **Analyst** receives this report via context injection.
4.  **Analyst** pulls the latest 4H candles, RSI, and EMA data.
5.  **Analyst** determines if the Technicals match the Fundamentals.
6.  **Final Output:** A structured Trade Signal (Entry, Stop Loss, Take Profit).

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/infcloud01/xaucopilot.git
cd xaucopilot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
We use the `ddgs` library directly to handle search without rate limits.
```bash
pip install crewai yfinance pandas ddgs
```

### 3. Set Up API Keys
This project relies on an LLM (default is OpenAI GPT-4). You need to set your API key.

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Option B: Python Script**
Edit `xaucopilot.py` and set `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` manually (not recommended for public repos).

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python xaucopilot.py
```

### Example Output

You will see the agents "thinking" in the terminal:

```text
[Tool Log] Searching DuckDuckGo (Past 24h) for: 'Gold Price News'...
[Tool Log] Fetching 4H Price Data from Yahoo Finance...

################################################
## FINAL RECOMMENDATION ##
################################################

Trade Signal: BUY XAU/USD
Entry: 2650.50
Stop Loss: 2630.00 (Below 50 EMA)
Take Profit: 2690.00
Reasoning: Manager sentiment is Bullish due to safe-haven demand. 
Price is holding above the 50 EMA, confirming the uptrend. RSI is healthy at 55.
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

**"RuntimeWarning: package `duckduckgo_search` has been renamed"**
*   This project is updated to use the new `ddgs` library. The script also includes a warning filter to keep your terminal output clean.

**"Tool Validation Errors"**
*   We use the native `crewai.tools.BaseTool` class inheritance. This avoids Pydantic version conflicts common between LangChain and CrewAI.
